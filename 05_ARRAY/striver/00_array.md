## SUBARRAY AND SUBSEQUENCE

# SUBARRAY :

Subarray is a contigous part of an array

# SUBSEQUENCE :

Subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Number of Subarrays in an Array:

An array of length 'n' has a total of (n√ó(n+1))/2 subarrays.

## Number of Subsequences in an Array:

An array of length 'n' has a total of 2^n subsequences.

## SOLUTION APPROACH

# SUBARRAY

Mainly solve hota hai sliding window se.

# SUBSEQUENCE

Mainly solve hota hai recursion se.
